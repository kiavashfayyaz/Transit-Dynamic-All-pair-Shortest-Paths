# Transit-Dynamic-All-pair-Shortest-Paths
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185333

The code is written in C++ with the following files:
1. Route.h: Route class header file
2. StopClass.h: Stop class header file
3. Trip.h Trip class header file
4. Route, StopClass, and Trip source file provide the class codes corresponding to the header files
5. Functions.h: Walking distance calculation function
6. ShortestPath.h: Shortest path finding function
7. MultiThreading.h: functions for using multiple cores for calculation
8. CodeMain: the main code which reads the data file and find the weighted average travel time and dynamic all-pairs shortest path between stations for specified departure times

The link provided above links you to the paper that describes the calculation and algorithm in detail.
